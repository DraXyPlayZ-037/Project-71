                    <h5>Decide who serves first. A coin toss or racket spin is a good way to decide who should serve first. Since the tennis serve is an inherent advantage to the player serving, it is only fair to let chance determine who will get to. Once you determine who serves, the server only has two opportunities to get the ball in. Should they hit it out, into the net, or step on the line while serving, it is considered a fault. Failing to land your second serve will result in a double fault, and the loss of the point.
Alternate serving sides. The first serve of each game starts on the right side of the court, also known as the “deuce side” of the court. The next point comes from the left side, also known as the “ad court” (short for “advantage”). Serve sides are always alternated, and unless you’re doing a second serve, you should never serve from the same side twice in a row.
Use your arsenal. Whether you use your left hand or right hand, your forehand and backhand groundstrokes will be instrumental in winning points, along with your serve. Be sure to play to your strengths (for example, if you’re a player whose backhand is stronger than their forehand, try to maneuver your footwork around down the middle balls so you can hit more of them).
Use your mind. You’ll have to make quick decisions as to which tennis strokes you’re going to use—like whether to stay at the baseline with your basic strokes or serve and volley, how much topspin to use, or whether you attempt a winner or try to keep the ball in play longer to push the opposing player to make an unforced error.
Change playing sides on the odd games. Having equal conditions for each player contributes to a fair game; this is especially true for outdoor courts. The sun and the wind can be major factors when playing tennis, and certain sides of the court may be more affected than others. When the sum of the games is an odd number, the players switch sides (for example, 1-0, 3-2, 5-0, etc.). This means that the players will always switch after the first game, and then after every two games after that.
Be prepared for a tiebreak. Sometimes, each player wins an equal amount of games, bringing the score to 6-6. In that case, the players enter a tiebreak, which is played out of seven points, and must also be won by two. An example of a game score with a tiebreak would be 7-6 (to represent the games) and 7-5 (to represent the tiebreak points).</h5>

                    <h5>Get a ball and a hoop. All you need to play basketball is a ball of the appropriate size and a net that it fits through, set at a challenging-enough height. The specific requirements for regulation basketball are included below, but the history of basketball is the history of making do with what you have. The first basketball hoop was a peach crate nailed to a railing. Use empty boxes, soccer balls, or whatever is available if you don’t have access to a hoop.Break into two teams. For a full-court game, basketball is played by two teams of five players each.[4] While it's also common to play half-court ball with teams of three, however many people you've got playing, it's important to have an even number of players on each team. Alternate basketball games for uneven numbers are included in the last section. Score points by shooting the ball through the hoop. In basketball, an offensive player can score between one and three points with a shot, depending on where the shot is taken on the floor.Move the ball by dribbling or passing. When you have the ball, you have to either be stationary, with one foot planted on the floor to pivot from, or you have to be dribbling the ball, bouncing it up and down on the floor. When you're planted, you can pivot around on one foot, but that foot has to remain planted if you're not dribbling. You can still jump to shoot or pass, but when you come back down you need to have gotten rid of the ball.</h5>

                    <h5>Know the main point of the game. The goal of American football is to score points by carrying the ball from a starting point on a 120-yard long and 53.3-yard wide field into a specially marked 10-yard-deep area at either end of the field called an end zone. Each team uses the end zone in front of them to score while trying to prevent the opposing team from reaching the end zone behind them. Each end zone has a Y-shaped structure called the field goal which is positioned on the end line. The field goals are used to score points with special kicks.Learn the time divisions. Football is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, with a break between the second and third periods called “halftime” that is normally 12 minutes long. While the clock is active, the game is divided into even shorter segments called “plays" or "downs." Learn the flow of the game. American football is made up of two basic structural elements that guide play. These are the kickoff and the downs system.Learn about the composition of a team. Each team is allowed to have eleven players on the field at once. Different team members hold different positions and have different duties on the field. Most competitive teams are actually composed of three separate teams of players, each of which is rotated onto the field to perform one type of task. Keep track of your score. The goal of the game is to score more points than the opposing team. In the case of a tie, an additional 15 minute overtime period is usually played. Scoring is as follows</h5>

                    <h5> Practice dribbling the ball. Dribbling is controlling the ball while running. If you want to keep the ball in your team's possession, you're going to need to dribble well. Dribbling is all about touching the ball strong enough to carry it forward, but light enough so that it stays at your feet.Work on your passing skills. Passing is all about putting the ball exactly where you want it. In order to pass a soccer ball, kick the ball using the inside of your foot. This will give you less power but more accuracy. Once you master the basic pass, you can then try to slice and hook the ball in order to pass it to one of your teammates.Hone your shooting skills. If you're really close to the goal and all you need is accuracy, you can shoot using the sweet spot of the inside of your foot, like a pass. Normally, though, you're going to be farther away and will need power as well as accuracy.Build your skills as a defender. Defending the goal from an opposing attacker is an underrated achievement. There are 3 basic things that you need to remember when guarding a player in soccer</h5>
